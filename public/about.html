<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Tanishq Ghuge, a third-year Chemical Engineering student at BITS Pilani with a strong passion for solving complex problems at the intersection of science, technology, and business. My academic journey has given me hands-on experience in research, process design, and simulation, while my curiosity has pushed me to explore applications in fields such as rare earth extraction, sustainable processes, and advanced trading systems.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I’m deeply interested in finance, quantitative trading, and AI-driven solutions. Over time, I’ve built projects that merge technology with market dynamics, from machine learning–based trading strategies to full-stack applications. I see challenges as opportunities to innovate, and I’m driven by the vision of creating impactful startups that combine technical precision with real-world utility.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I’m an athlete at heart—a football goalkeeper for my college team and someone who values discipline, fitness, and self-improvement. Whether it’s on the field, in the gym, or through yoga and mindfulness, I believe in pushing boundaries and staying balanced. This same mindset fuels my personal and professional life: to grow, adapt, and constantly strive for excellence.</p>
